# Market Basket Analysis using Apriori Algorithm

This project implements the Apriori algorithm for market basket analysis to discover association rules within transactional datasets. Market basket analysis is a technique used to discover associations between items in a dataset. The Apriori algorithm is a classic algorithm for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning. This project provides an implementation of the Apriori algorithm to identify frequently purchased itemsets and generate association rules, revealing valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior. Features include: Efficient implementation of the Apriori algorithm for frequent itemset mining; Association rule generation (e.g., "If A, then B") based on support, confidence, and lift metrics; Customizable parameters allowing users to adjust minimum support and minimum confidence thresholds; Data loading support for various file formats (e.g., CSV); Result visualization options to display and analyze frequent itemsets and association rules; Clear and documented code for easy understanding and modification.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]; cd [repository_directory]`
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Create a `requirements.txt` file listing necessary packages, such as `pandas`.)

## Usage

1.  Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is in a suitable format (e.g., CSV), with each row representing a transaction and each column representing an item. Place your dataset in the project directory.
2.  Run the script: `python apriori.py --input [input_file.csv] --min_support [0.01] --min_confidence [0.5]` (Replace `[input_file.csv]` with the name of your dataset file. Adjust `[0.01]` and `[0.5]` with your desired minimum support and minimum confidence thresholds.)
3.  Analyze the results: The script will output the frequent itemsets and association rules, along with their support, confidence, and lift values. If you've included visualization code, it will run as well.

## Example

Assuming your `transactions.csv` file looks like this:

```csv
Item1,Item2,Item3
Milk,Bread,Eggs
Bread,Butter,
Milk,Butter,
Milk,Bread,Butter
